	 NOBagency opens its own virtual concept store NOBconcept.
</p>

<p>
	 NOBconcept is a virtual concept store with a selection of the most progressive and vibrant brands from the NOB team. This is the new chapter of the project, which already includes the NOBagency fashion agency with an office in the centre of Moscow and the NOBshowroom space in Paris.

	 The main goal of NOB is to find and support young designers who form their own style, transmitting truly innovative ideas through collections. The NOB team accompanies them at all stages of development: from strategy formation and production adjustment to distribution. The fame of the brand and its popularity do not matter for NOB, the main thing is the conceptual vision, high quality, personal style and potential.

	 The NOBconcept virtual concept store focuses on agency residents - designers selected by the team through their own NOB Talents contest. There are four main ones at the moment. This is Odor by Nikita Kalmykov, working with new masculinity, ephemeral and fragile; Red September by Olga Vasyukova's high street fashion brand, inspired by industrial design; Roma Uvarov Design, the phantasmagoric and completely insane brand by Roman Uvarov, as well as Into Into, which is a surreal brand of jewellery and accessories balancing poetry and science.

<p>
	 All of them are constant heroes of international publications, from Dazed, Garage and i-D to Vogue Italia. And the real faces of fresh and vibrant Russian fashion, which keeps up with the world. Items and accessories from their current collections through NOBconcept can often be bought literally right from the catwalk - in the format see now, buy now.

	 The assortment of the online store will be constantly updated. The resident quartet will be added with other Russian brands of the same high level and foreign brands from the NOBshowroom portfolio, in demand in Europe, Asia and America.
